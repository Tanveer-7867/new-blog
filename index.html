      <h2>Places I've Explored</h2>

      <!-- Repeat this block for each place -->
      <div class="place">
        <h3>The Himalayas (Spiti & Ladakh)</h3>
        <p>
          In the high-altitude cold deserts of Ladakh and Spiti, I journeyed along dusty trails and icy paths. From the ancient monasteries perched on cliffs to the glacial rivers cutting through crimson canyons, every moment felt like stepping into a sci-fi landscape. Nights here bring a Milky Way that blazes brighter than any neon skyline, and the silence is so pure it often speaks louder than words.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place">
        <h3>Andaman & Nicobar Islands</h3>
        <p>
          Beneath the surface of Havelock’s reefs, I discovered a coral metropolis alive with electric hues—schools of fish flashing like neon sprites, sea turtles gliding gracefully, and waves glowing with phosphorescence. On moonlit beaches, the sand glimmers with bioluminescent particles like scattered circuit boards.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place">
        <h3>Western Ghats (Kerala & Karnataka)</h3>
        <p>
          Hiking through rain-soaked jungles in Wayanad and Coorg felt like entering a living cathedral. Giant butterflies flit through moss-draped trees, monkeys chatter overhead, and unexpected waterfalls roar with monsoon fury. The air is thick and alive—every drop of rain a pixel in nature’s projection.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place">
        <h3>Thar Desert, Rajasthan</h3>
        <p>
          Across Jaisalmer’s golden dunes I rode camels at dawn. Endless sands stretch beneath a sky untainted by light pollution, revealing constellations that seemed designed for alien worlds. Nights here pulse with silence and depth—a cosmic contrast to cyberpunk chaos.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place">
        <h3>Sundarbans Mangroves</h3>
        <p>
          Paddling through mangrove labyrinths, I heard no roads—only tides lapping against tangled roots. Occasional glimpses of Bengal tiger eyes reflected like LEDs in the dusk. Saltwater, sun, and silence blend here, revealing Earth’s soft power amid tidal calm.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place">
        <h3>Meghalaya (Cherrapunji & Mawlynnong)</h3>
        <p>
          In the “land of clouds,” I walked across living root bridges crafted over centuries. Mist enveloped everything—trees draped in moss, streams flowing like data lines. This rain-drenched realm felt both ancient and algorithmic, each step a rhythmic echo in a wet circuit board of life.
